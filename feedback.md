### Sophistication of your design
Interesting pet with engaging interactions. Good use of memory to store pet state.

### Sophistication of your implementation
Great work, lots of extensions with RNG and sound integration. 
Theres a few places to improve the implementation, you've used delay loops in a few places, this could be better accomplished with a timer and interrupts.
You could also use the rng interrupt instead of a delay.

### Sophistication of analysis and evaluation
You've suggested some issues with your design but don't go into much detail analysing them. How does this affect your design, are there alternatives which may fix the problems e.g. why is it an issue if you don't follow the calling convention.
Otherwise good overview of the pet and its implementation.

### Sophistication of communication and expression
Design document is clear and well written.
